# Action Bar

![Action Bar](./images/action-bar.png)

The Action Bar is where all the non-game related actions live. Almost no
work has been spend on its UI so expect it to change in the future. The
actions are:

- **Start/Stop auto tracking** starts and stops the auto tracker. See the
  [Auto Tracking](./03_auto_tracking.md) Chapter for more information.
- **Dump** dumps application state to the console. This is not useful
  unless you are running the app from the command line.
- **Broadcast View** opens the broadcast view window. See the
  [Broadcast View Window](./02_quick_start_broadcast_window.md) section for more information
- **Config** opens the config window. See the [Config Window](./02_quick_start_config_window.md)
  section for more information.
